## About me
#
**Hi!** My name is **_Alex_**, I am a web designer and developer. 
I like convenient and beautiful sites. 
I have a bachelor's degree in __mechanical engineering technology__, but I like to develop in the Web field.
At the moment I am getting a bachelor's degree in **web development** at Synergy University and I plan to enroll in a master's program in **project management**.
In my spare time I like to _read scientific and fiction literature, travel and run_.
